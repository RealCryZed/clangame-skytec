# ClanGame test task for SkyTec
When the program starts, 20 threads are created (random number for UserAddGoldService and TaskService). They are executed using the ExecutorService. Next, user is asked to display the information that was saved in the database after the program was executed:
* Type 'tasks' in cmd to show all transactions made by completing tasks
* Type 'deposits' in cmd to show all transactions made by donations
* Type 'clans' in cmd to show all clans
